## üåæ About

Agri-Trek is a specialized software solution designed to computerize farmer and land details along with beneficiary schemes information. The platform integrates advanced aerial image analysis capabilities using trajectory-based clustering algorithms to help identify patterns and insights from drone or satellite imagery of agricultural lands.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Farmer Management**: Register and manage farmer profiles with personal and contact details
- **Land Parcel Management**: Track land ownership, size, location, and characteristics
- **Scheme Management**: Configure and monitor government schemes and benefits
- **Beneficiary Tracking**: Link farmers to schemes and track application status
- **Aerial Data Analysis**: Upload and process aerial imagery
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Precision clustering of objects identified in aerial imagery
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of key metrics and insights
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
